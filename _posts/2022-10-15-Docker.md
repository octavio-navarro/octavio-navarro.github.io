A platform that has been on my mind for some time now is [Docker][why_docker]. I have seen several references to its usefulness, and I think it could be rather interesting to learn what it it, how it works, and put it all into practice. One of such references is the [Stackoverflow developer survey of 2022][stackoverflow_2022]. Specifically, the most popular technologies:

Other than being useful for some classes, looking through job postings in Linkedin, several posts require some experience with Docker.
