# Starting a blog with Github pages

In an attempt to get myself to learn things outside of my current course materials, I though it would be a good idea to start a blog to record the process. The first of, hopefully, several posts, is actually setting the blog up.

## Following a tutorial

After a quick google search, I decided to use GitHub pages. I found several tutorials, but found [Chad Baldwin's Tutorial][1] particularly simple. You can also find all the base code at [his github page][git]. All the steps are quite straightforward, so I just followed them to the letter.

The one thing that was bothering me, was seeing the blog locally. 

## Setting up a local server

So, the next step was to set up a development platform. I could use WSL and install everything there, or use this as another learning opportunity: learning Docker.

That could very well be another post, so I'll be back here once that one is done.

### Additional Jekyll templates

I found additional templates that could be useful eventually:
